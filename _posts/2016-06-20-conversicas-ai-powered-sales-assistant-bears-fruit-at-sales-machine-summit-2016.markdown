Conversica, the only provider of artificial intelligence-based lead engagement software for marketing and sales, will showcase their AI (artificial intelligence) powered sales assistant this week at the Sales Machine Summit in New York, which is jointly presented by Salesforce and Sales Hacker.

Conversica is staffing its Sales Machine farm stand with happy lead farmers ready to explain how its AI sales assistant automatically cherry-picks the best leads for Sales, working 24x7, verifying contact information, collecting purchase requirements and even helping to set appointments. The assistant contacts, engages, nurtures, qualifies and follows up with leads via natural email conversations with no human intervention required. In this way, the software identifies the hottest leads, tracks the best lead sources, re-engages old leads and enables a higher return on marketing investment (ROI).

"We know that life is not a bowl of cherries for salespeople trying to hit their numbers every week, month or quarter," said Carl Landers, Chief Marketing Officer at Conversica. "Trying to follow up on every single lead, as many times as it takes to engage them, is just the pits. So Conversica offers an automated assistant that does the typically-manual job of picking the best leads, and then hands the ripe ones directly to Sales. We look forward to showing Sales Machine attendees how they can spend more time closing deals rather than chasing leads."

As a highlight of the Summit, Conversica will compete in the Sales App Demo Jam on Thursday afternoon, showing in just three minutes how AI is being used in natural, two-way email conversations. According to Landers, "We're thrilled to be presenting in the demo jam because, honestly, this is a technology you have to see to believe!"

Sales Machine attendees are invited to visit the Conversica farm stand for a live product demonstration, hourly giveaways and a photo op with the company's top human cherry-pickers!

Sales Machine is being held at Pier 94 in New York City on June 15 and 16. For more information, visit the event's website at www.salesmachinesummit.com or go directly to https://www.conversica.com/
